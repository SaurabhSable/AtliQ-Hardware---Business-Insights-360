## üåü Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding global company, sells computers and accessories through retailers, direct sales, and distributors. Despite its growth, the opening of a new store in America led to unexpected losses, highlighting the need for deeper insights.

With competitors using advanced analytics, AtliQ Hardware saw the value of building strong analytics capabilities. The project aimed to support data-driven decisions across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain functions using Power BI.

I contributed to this project by applying my learnings from the Codebasics Power BI Course, focusing on creating meaningful dashboards and reports.

## üìä Datasets
The analysis used two types of tables:

gdb041:
- **Dimension Tables:** Customer, Market, and Product data.

gdb056:
- **Fact Tables:** Sales and forecast data to analyze trends and improve customer satisfaction while reducing storage costs.

### Data Sources
- `dim_customer`, `dim_market`, `dim_product`
- `fact_forecast_monthly`, `fact_sales_monthly`
- Additional tables: `freight_cost`, `gross_price`, `manufacturing_cost`, `pre_invoice_deductions`, `post_invoice_deductions`

## üîç Why Data Modeling?
Data modeling is crucial for building a solid analytical report. It bridges the gap between raw data and valuable insights.

Steps in analysis:
1. **Data Extraction**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Data Modeling** (Key to report performance)
4. **Data Analysis**

This project used a **Snowflake schema** to ensure the dashboard is fast and reliable.
